# Contributing to AgentLoom

**Welcome!** Thank you for your interest in advancing the field of production-grade agentic AI engineering.

This project is unique: we're not just building software—we're establishing a **new way of engineering intelligent systems** that learn, evolve, and operate reliably in production environments.

---

## 🎯 Understanding the Dual-Helix Framework

Before contributing, understand that this project consists of two complementary repositories:

- **[AgentLoom](https://github.com/Keven1894/AgentLoom)** (this repo) — Engineering strand: how agents learn and evolve
- **[co-agenticOS](https://github.com/Keven1894/co-agenticOS)** — Governance strand: rules, boundaries, human-AI interaction

**Both are necessary for reliable agentic intelligence.** See [Dual-Helix Clarification](docs/dual-helix-clarification.md) for details.

## 🤖 The Agentic Collaboration Method

**Critical Understanding:** This project operates at **AI-augmented velocity**—10,000+ lines of code and 30+ documents per day using AI agents.

**This means:**

- ❌ **Traditional contribution methods won't keep pace** (manual coding, conventional workflows)
- ✅ **You must use AI-agent-enabled workflows** (Cursor, Claude, or similar tools)

### Prerequisites for Meaningful Contribution

**Required:**

1. **AI-Enabled IDE** — Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or equivalent AI-augmented development environment
2. **LLM Access** — Claude, GPT-4/5, or capable local models (Llama 3.1 8B+)
3. **Agentic Mindset** — Direct agents, don't code manually at traditional pace

**Recommended Reading:**

- [Agentic Collaboration Guide](docs/agentic-collaboration-guide.md) — **Essential reading!**
- [Framework Foundations](docs/framework-foundations.md) — Understand the theoretical basis
- [Dual-Helix Clarification](docs/dual-helix-clarification.md) — Engineering vs. Governance

### The Workflow Pattern (From DIVA Case Study)

**1. Institutional Memory Setup**

- Structure: Tiered `.cursor/rules/` configuration
- Result: 100% consistency, 87% token efficiency

**2. Plan-First Discipline**

- Create plan document before implementation
- No coding without approved plan
- Capture lessons in summaries

**3. Multi-Model Orchestration**

- Use right model for each task
- Balance: complexity, privacy, speed, cost

**4. Documentation as Workflow**

- Before: Plan
- During: Comment
- After: Summary
- Always: Update indexes

**5. Bounded Autonomy**

- Clear boundaries on what agent can/cannot do
- Approval gates for significant changes
- Build trust gradually

**Full details:** [Agentic Collaboration Guide](docs/agentic-collaboration-guide.md)
