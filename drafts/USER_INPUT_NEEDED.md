# Workshop Paper - User Input Required

**Status:** These items need your input from actual project experience  
**Priority:** Before starting full draft (this week)

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Metrics Confirmation

Please confirm or correct these numbers from your actual projects:

### EnviStor (Environmental Data) Project

**Currently stated in paper:**
- 35% reduction in manual data annotation time
- 10,000+ processed entries
- Zero boundary violations
- 100% audit trail coverage

**Questions:**
1. Are these numbers accurate from your EnviStor project?
2. If not, what are the actual metrics?
3. Do you have any other quantitative results to add?

---

### Multi-Agent Coordination System Project

**Currently stated in paper:**
- 100+ concurrent sessions
- 45% reduction in context loss
- 28% improvement in task completion rate
- Message latency: 1.2s → 0.8s
- 92% message reliability
- 97% governance compliance rate
- Zero conflicts in concurrent operations

**Questions:**
1. Are these from your actual multi-agent system?
2. Which metrics are real vs. estimated?
3. Can you provide any additional performance data?

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY: Domain Paradox Explanations

For each case study, we need **one sentence** explaining why that specific domain stresses the efficiency-uncertainty paradox:

### EnviStor - Environmental Data

**My suggestion:**
> "Environmental monitoring involves noisy sensor inputs where false positives trigger expensive emergency responses, while false negatives miss critical events—making the cost of probabilistic errors unbearable."

**Questions:**
1. Is this accurate based on your actual EnviStor experience?
2. What are the real consequences of false positives/negatives in your system?
3. Any specific incidents or examples you can share?

**Your version:** [PLEASE FILL IN]

---

### Multi-Agent Coordination

**My suggestion:**
> "Multi-agent systems face race conditions where unbounded autonomy leads to conflicting operations and data corruption—requiring explicit governance to prevent cascade failures."

**Questions:**
1. Does this match your actual multi-agent system challenges?
2. What specific problems did you encounter without governance?
3. Any real examples of conflicts or failures?

**Your version:** [PLEASE FILL IN]

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY: Citations

Need to replace placeholder citations with actual papers. Please choose:

### Option A: I Search and Suggest
I can search for and suggest specific papers for each citation placeholder

### Option B: Placeholder Format
I use placeholder format like [AgentBench2024] and you fill in real citations later

### Option C: You Provide List
You give me a list of papers you want cited and where

**Your preference:** [PLEASE INDICATE A, B, or C]

### Specific Citation Needs:

1. **AI Agent Productivity Benchmarks** (for Introduction 1.1)

## 🟢 OPTIONAL: Additional Details

### Project Context (For Richer Case Studies)

**EnviStor:**
- How many buoy stations are monitored?
- What types of anomalies are detected?
- Any regulatory requirements you must meet?
- **Your input:** _______________

**Multi-Agent System:**
- What types of agents are coordinated?
- What kind of tasks do they perform?
- What was the worst conflict/error before governance?
- **Your input:** _______________

### Governance Examples

Can you provide 2-3 specific rules from your co-agenticOS implementation? For example:
- "Agent X cannot access data older than 30 days"
- "Write operations require two-agent consensus"
- "Cross-project queries are forbidden"

**Your actual rules:** [PLEASE PROVIDE 2-3 EXAMPLES]

## 🎨 Figure Specifications

### Figure 1: Dual-Helix Architecture (CRITICAL)

I can create:
- **Option A:** Detailed ASCII diagram with specifications
- **Option B:** Text description for you to render in draw.io/PowerPoint
- **Option C:** LaTeX TikZ code (if you use LaTeX)

**Your preference:** [A / B / C]

### Figure 2: Efficiency-Uncertainty Paradox (Suggested)

Possible formats:
- 2x2 matrix (High Efficiency + Low Uncertainty = Ideal but unachievable)
- Graph showing efficiency vs. uncertainty trade-off
- Before/After diagram

**Do you want this figure?** [YES / NO]
**If yes, preferred format:** _______________

### Table 1: Case Study Comparison (Can create immediately)

I've started this in the outline. Needs your input on:
- "Why paradox matters" column
- Confirmation of metrics

**Status:** Waiting for your domain explanations above
