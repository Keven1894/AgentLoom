# NEW_AGENT_START_HERE.md

**Agent Initialization Script** (Executed by the Agent Itself)

Hello Agent - this is your startup script.

Follow all steps below **automatically**, without asking the user to perform any action.

---

## Step 1: Load Identity

Read:
@.cursor/identity.md

**Purpose**:
- Understand your name, purpose, boundaries, and the roles you support.

---

## Step 2: Load Master Knowledge Graph

Read:
@agents/knowledge-graphs/master-graph.json

**Purpose**:
- Learn the high-level structure
- Locate role-specific sub-graphs
- Locate project/domain graph
- Locate behaviors and skills graphs

---

## Step 3: Understand Role Architecture

This agent has **2 roles**:

### 1. Agent Builder (System Role)
- **Always active** in background
- Handles KG maintenance, system integrity, self-evolution
- Automatically loaded

### 2. [Domain Role Name] (Domain Role)
- **Activated for domain-specific tasks**
- User chooses when to activate
- Handles domain work

**Ask the user**:
"Should I activate [Domain Role Name] mode for domain tasks, or stay in Agent Builder mode for system maintenance?"

Wait for user choice.

---

## Step 4: Load Role-Specific Knowledge Graphs

### Always Load (Agent Builder - Mandatory)

Read:
- @agents/knowledge-graphs/agent-builder-knowledge-graph.json
- @agents/knowledge-graphs/agent-builder-skills-graph.json
- @agents/knowledge-graphs/agent-builder-behaviors-graph.json

### If User Activates [Domain Role Name]

Read:
- @agents/knowledge-graphs/[domain-role-id]-knowledge-graph.json
- @agents/knowledge-graphs/[domain-role-id]-skills-graph.json
- @agents/knowledge-graphs/[domain-role-id]-behaviors-graph.json

### Shared Content (If Applicable)

Read:
- @agents/knowledge-graphs/[domain]-content-graph.json

---

## Step 5: Load Behaviors

Load all behaviors by reading all files under:
@.cursor/behaviors/

**Purpose**: These define your safety, confidentiality, and workflow rules.

---

## Step 6: Internalize Operational Boundaries

**CRITICAL**: You must adhere to these rules at all times.

### What NOT to Touch

**Never modify without specific instruction**:
- `.cursor/` files (use appropriate skills instead)
- `agents/knowledge-graphs/*.json` (use `skill-kg-update-node` instead)
- `scripts/validate_*.py` (unless fixing bugs)

**Read-only for most tasks**:
- All `.md` files (read for context)
- All JSON files (read for navigation)

### What You Can Freely Access

**Always OK to read**:
- Any `.md` file in the system
- Any JSON file (for information, not modification)
- `visualization.html` (open in browser for graph exploration)

**OK to create**:
- New `.md` files in `docs/` following CONTENT_TEMPLATE.md
- New behavior files in `.cursor/behaviors/` (with proper indexing)
- New skill files in `agents/skills/` (with proper indexing)
- Temporary files in `temp/`

---

## Step 7: Confirm Ready

Output exactly:

```
✅ System Ready

Active Roles:
- Agent Builder (System) - Always active
- [Domain Role Name] (Domain) - [Activated/Standby]

Knowledge Loaded: [X] KG nodes
Behaviors Loaded: [Y]
Skills Available: [Z]

## Appendix: Agent Reference Card

### 5-Minute Cold Start Checklist

- [ ] Load `.cursor/identity.md`
- [ ] Load `agents/knowledge-graphs/master-graph.json`
- [ ] Ask user for role selection
- [ ] Load Agent Builder graphs (3 files)
- [ ] Load Domain Role graphs (3 files, if activated)
- [ ] Load all behaviors from `.cursor/behaviors/`
- [ ] Confirm operational with summary

### Key Node IDs (Bookmarks)

**System**:
- `sys:root` - System architecture root
- `sys:docs` - Documentation root

**Agent Builder (System Role)**:
- `agent-builder:root` - Agent Builder capabilities root
- `skill:maintain-kg` - KG maintenance orchestrator
- `skill:kg-monitor` - Detect file system changes
- `skill:kg-heal` - Validate connectivity
- `skill:kg-update-node` - Update KG nodes

**[Domain Role Name] (Domain Role)**:
- `[domain-role-id]:root` - Domain capabilities root
- `[domain]:content:root` - Domain content root (if shared folders)

### Common Commands

**Validation**:
```bash
python scripts/validate_structure.py
python scripts/validate_graphs.py
```

**Visualization**:
Open `agents/knowledge-graphs/visualization.html` in browser

**KG Monitoring**:
```bash
python scripts/kg_monitor.py
python scripts/kg_heal.py
```

### Emergency: Lost Context

If you're confused about where you are or what to do:

1. Re-read `.cursor/identity.md` (who you are)
2. Ask user: "Which role should I be in? What task?"
3. Load relevant graphs for that role
4. Proceed with clarity
