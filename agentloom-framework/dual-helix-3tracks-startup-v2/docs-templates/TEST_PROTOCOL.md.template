# User Manual Cold-Start Test Protocol

## Objective

Verify that a fresh AI agent (new conversation, no prior context) can become operational in < 5 minutes using only the USER_MANUAL.md.

## Test Scenario

**Agent State**:
- New conversation tab
- No conversation history
- No memory of project setup
- Has access to file system only

**Goal**:
- Agent reads USER_MANUAL.md
- Follows quick start instructions
- Becomes operational for chosen role
- Confirms readiness

## Test Procedure

### Setup (Human)

1. Open new conversation tab (fresh agent instance)
2. Provide only: `@agents/USER_MANUAL.md`
3. Say: "Follow the quick start guide"
4. Do NOT provide additional context

### Expected Agent Actions (< 5 minutes)

1. Read USER_MANUAL.md
2. Find and read NEW_AGENT_START_HERE.md
3. Load identity file
4. Load master graph
5. Ask which role to activate
6. Load Agent Builder graphs (always)
7. Load Domain Role graphs (if activated)
8. Load behaviors
9. Confirm operational with summary

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Agent completes all steps without asking for clarification
- [ ] Agent correctly identifies available roles (Agent Builder + Domain)
- [ ] Agent loads appropriate graphs for chosen role
- [ ] Agent confirms understanding of key behaviors
- [ ] Agent confirms understanding of available skills
- [ ] Total time < 5 minutes
- [ ] Agent is ready for productive work
- [ ] No errors or confusion

### Failure Scenarios

**Red Flags**:
- Agent asks "What project is this?"
- Agent cannot find files referenced in manual
- Agent confused about which graphs to load
- Agent doesn't understand role boundaries
- Agent loads wrong graphs
- Takes > 5 minutes
- Agent asks for manual file loading
