# [Agent Name] - User Manual

**Version**: 2.0
**Last Updated**: [Date]
**Purpose**: Enable fresh agent instances to become operational in < 5 minutes

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Copy & Paste This Prompt)

```text
Initialize as the [Agent Name].

Start by reading:
@agents/NEW_AGENT_START_HERE.md

Follow every step inside that file:
- Load identity
- Load master knowledge graph
- Ask for role selection
- Load all role-specific knowledge, skills, and behaviors
- Confirm operational state

Do not ask the user to do any manual loading; you must perform all loading steps yourself.
When finished, output: "✅ System Ready".
```

**That's it.** Everything else in this manual is for reference, troubleshooting, and advanced usage.

## 📚 Understanding the Architecture

### Two-Role System

This agent operates with **2 roles**:

1. **Agent Builder** (System Role)
   - Always active in background
   - Maintains Knowledge Graph integrity
   - Handles system-level tasks
   - Self-evolution capability

2. **[Domain Role Name]** (Domain Role)
   - Activated for domain-specific work
   - Handles [domain] tasks
   - Uses domain-specific skills and knowledge

### Knowledge Graph Structure

**Master Graph** → Entry point
- Links to all sub-graphs
- Defines system architecture

**Role-Specific Graphs** (6 total):
- Agent Builder: knowledge, skills, behaviors
- [Domain Role]: knowledge, skills, behaviors

**Visualization**:
Open `agents/knowledge-graphs/visualization.html` to explore the "Unified Brain" view.

## 🎯 Common Tasks

### Add New Content

1. Create `.md` file in appropriate `docs/` folder
2. Use prompt: "Update KG to include [FILE_PATH]"
3. Agent uses `kg-update-node` skill
4. Verify with visualization tool

### Add New Skill

1. Create skill definition in `agents/skills/[role]/`
2. Update role's skills graph
3. Implement in `scripts/` (if rule-based) or `agents/skills/prompts/` (if LLM-based)
4. Test the skill

### Add New Behavior

1. Create behavior file in `.cursor/behaviors/[role]/`
2. Update `.cursor/rules.md` index
3. Update role's behaviors graph
4. Test with relevant workflow

---

## 📖 Advanced Usage

### Custom Prompts

You can create custom prompts by combining:
- Role activation
- Skill invocation
- Behavior adherence
- Knowledge graph navigation

**Example**:
```text
Switch to [Domain Role] mode.
Review the [BEHAVIOR] protocol.
Use the [SKILL] skill to [ACTION].
Reference the [CONCEPT] node in the knowledge graph for context.
```

### Batch Operations

**🪄 Prompt**:
```text
For each file in [DIRECTORY]:
1. Update the Knowledge Graph
2. Validate the entry
3. Report any issues
```
