# Pattern: Graph Construction

## Pattern Overview

How to build knowledge graphs incrementally with 100% connectivity.

---

## The Pattern

```
1. Create root node
2. Add content nodes incrementally
3. Establish hierarchical links
4. Add semantic relationships
5. Create cross-track links
6. Validate connectivity
```

---

## Key Principles

1. **Start with Root**: Every graph needs an entry point
2. **Link Immediately**: Don't create orphaned nodes
3. **Hierarchy First**: Parent-child before semantic
4. **Cross-Track Last**: After individual graphs are stable
5. **Validate Continuously**: Check integrity after each batch
