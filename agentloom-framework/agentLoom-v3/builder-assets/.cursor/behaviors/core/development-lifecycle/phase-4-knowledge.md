# Phase 4: Build Track 2 (Knowledge)

**Parent**: [AgentLoom Development Lifecycle](./INDEX.md)

---

## Goal

Populate the `docs/` folder with the domain knowledge the agent needs to reference.

---

## 4.1 Organize Content Structure

Create subfolders in `docs/` based on the domain:

- `domain-content/`: Core subject matter.
- `procedures/`: "How-to" guides for users.
- `references/`: API docs, cheat sheets, data dictionaries.
- `faqs/`: Common questions and answers.

## 4.2 Import & Create Content

- **Import**: Convert existing documents to Markdown.
- **Create**: Write new documentation for gaps identified in Phase 1.
- **Index**: Update `docs/INDEX.md` to link to all major sections.

## 4.3 Document the System

Create meta-documentation about the agent itself:

- **Architecture**: How the agent is built.
- **Design Decisions**: Why certain choices were made.
- **Implementation**: Technical guides for maintainers.

---

**Output**: A comprehensive knowledge base in `docs/` that serves as the agent's long-term memory.
