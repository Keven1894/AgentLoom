title: "Agentic-AI Engineering Framework"
abstract: >
  A systematic methodology for building production-grade AI agents through a 
  closed learning loop: Context → Documentation → Indexing → RAG → Fine-Tuning.
  This framework transforms one-off AI experiments into continuous, evidence-based 
  AI systems that learn from doing, improve from feedback, and document their own reasoning.
