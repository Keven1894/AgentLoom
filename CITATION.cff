title: "AgentLoom: Building Trustworthy AI Agents Through Dual-Helix Architecture"
abstract: >
  AgentLoom is a production-ready framework for building reliable, trustworthy AI agents through dual-helix architecture.
  The Learning Helix (Context → Documentation → Indexing → RAG → Fine-Tuning) enables knowledge accumulation,
  while the Governance Helix (Rules → Coordination → Memory Boundaries → Verification → Adaptation) enforces
  operational safety. Together, they create Reliable Probabilistic Intelligence. The framework includes a 9-phase
  protocol with 95-98% success rate, enabling custom agentic AI systems in 2-4 hours.
